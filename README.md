# Opital is an e-health app 

Most Gambians do not know their blood type talkless of their medical history, which hinders doctors' diagnoses. Additionally, most of us travel miles to reach hospitals afterward have wait in a long queue before accessing a doctor.
It is very difficult to alert citizens when they come in contact with a COVID-19 infected person. Which makes it essential to have a platform which can quickly inform and educate the Gambian citizens about pandemics when the need arises.
