# Opital is an e-health app 

Most Gambians do not know their blood type talkless of their medical history, which hinders doctors' diagnoses. What if we can have a database system where every doctor in the Gambia, can have access to his or patients medical records thereby helping our doctors understand their patients. Most Gambians travel miles to reach hospitals afterward have wait in a long queue before accessing a doctor.
Additionally, it is very difficult to alert citizens when they come in contact with a COVID-19 infected person. Which makes it essential to have a platform which can quickly inform and educate the Gambian citizens about pandemics when the need arises.



My Project idea is Help manage health staff scheduling, predict and reduce appointment no-shows, save time on administrative tasks in our hospitals, prevent long hospital queues, helps patients to access healthcare 24/7, patients can schedule and reschedule appointments any time from anywhere, and patients can communicate with their care team in real-time.
